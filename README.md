## Notice
This software is in no way affiliated with Govee and was created in Python using Govee's Developer API. A personal access token is required to run this project, you can acquire one by going to About Us-> Request API Key in the Govee Home app!

## Example commands
Here is a list of example commands to get you started with Govee-API:

### Query Devices
To find out what devices can be used in this CLI, you can run the command **listdevices**.

```
goveeApi listdevices
```

This should return the following data about each device added to your account:
```
Device iid: Int
Device MAC: Str
Model Name: Str
Device Nickname: Str
Controllable: True
Retrievable: True
Commands: Str[]
```

### Turn Devices On or Off
Devices can be turned on using the **turn** command followed by the iid and the state (on/off)

```
goveeApi turn 0 on
```

This should turn the device with the iid of 0 on

### Change Device Brightness
The brightness of your device can be changed with the **brightness** command followed by iid and the integer value. The value must be between 1 and 100 without a percentage sign (%) after it.

```
goveeApi brightness 0 50
```

This should make the device with the iid of 0 have a brightness of 50%

### Change Device Colour
The colour of your device should be changed using the **color** command followed by the device's iid and the requested colour in a hexadecimal format (#RRGGBB) if you are stuck for colours, you can find some [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) There are a few colours you can also use such as **red**, **green**, **blue**, and **purple** etc.

```
goveeApi color 0 #0067f4
```

This should make the device with the iid of 0 display a blue-ish colour

### Change Device Colour Temperature
The colour temperature of your device should be changed using the **colortem** command followed by the device's iid and the requested colour temperature in an integer format between 2000 and 9000.

```
goveeApi colortem 0 2000
```

This should make the device with the iid of 0 display a warm white colour.
